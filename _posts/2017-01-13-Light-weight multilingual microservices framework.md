A multi-language, lightweight, high-performance microservices framework, users only need to care about application logic coding,without having to think about fault-tolerance, service load balance, etc.

## Background 

This project is based on java, Hprose and mqtt. The microservice system is consist of "Main Control Service(MCS)" , "api-gate" , "APP-service(AS)".

i)Due to the need to provide multiple backend services to the previous project such as video streaming, face-id database synchronization, receiving customer shopping data, admin management system, customer statistics data, etc. The logic is complex, so the backend provides data support in the form of microservices.
ii)Project backend code was written by multiple languages (java and php), and current mainstream frameworks rarely support multilingual.
iii)Current popular microservices framework is complex in configuration and need a lot of resources.
iV)Using traditional http is less efficient, and there are more tasks in the system that require multiple backend services, resulting in a large loss of resources.
