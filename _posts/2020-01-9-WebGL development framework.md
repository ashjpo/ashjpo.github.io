During this time I developed a 3D system based on WebGL. This system is similar to Unity 3D on the web side, which can perform model editing, game manufacturing, scene layout, etc. Users can upload mesh and materials on the web.

Although Unity 3D can be published to the web, there are many disadvantages, such as difficulty in interacting with the web and slow loading speed. Compared with Unity 3D, this 3D effect written directly on the web side has faster loading speed, lower rendering consumption, and more flexibility in web pages.

By using this system, you can easily build a native webgl application. This reduces the difficulty of previously writing code to develop webgl.

(This system is still under development. Most of the work has been done.)
