In this project, we use artificial intelligence and data analysis in the retail field. Provide store owners with customer or VIP identification, business data analysis,customer statistics, etc. 

## Background 

In this project, when the customer in front of the checkout counter, the program will automatically capture the face of customer, then identify VIP and frequent customer of the store. It will also record the age, gender and other attributes of the customer. When the customer checks out, the face-id data of customer will be matched with the shopping information. These information will then be uploaded to the cloud server. The above data will be linked to the previous information of this customer, such as shopping history, consumer preference, etc.

In addition, when customers enter the store, the VIP and the frequent customers will be identified by the camera at the entrance, then the information of this customer will be pushed to the shop employee's APP. The information includs the consumer preference, shopping history, purchase level, VIP number, etc. Furthermore, the camera will also statistics the number of different ages and genders customers.

Finally, in the admin website, we will show analyzed data to brand managers, such as store transaction rate, buyer retention rate, product sales forecast, customer preferences, product portraits, etc.
